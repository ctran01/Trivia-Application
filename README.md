# Trivia Application

## Introduction

I made this application using ReactJS via createreactapp.

### `Starting the application`

To start the application, simply navigate to the project directory, type npm install in your terminal install the packages, and then type npm run in your terminal to run the web application. It should open up a web application running on localhost:3000.

### `Additional Features`

I would like to eventually have a question directory on the left menu bar that allows users to go back to questions they have already answered.
